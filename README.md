### 📌 Project Description

This project is a simple **Sign-Up Web Application** built using **Apache Tomcat**.

It demonstrates how to handle basic user registration in a Java web environment without using a database. Instead, user credentials (username and password) are stored in a local text file within the servlet directory.

### 🎯 Purpose

The main goal of this project is to support a **multiplayer game running on a Local Area Network (LAN)**. Since the application is intended for local use only (not deployed on the internet), it simplifies implementation by avoiding database integration and advanced security mechanisms.

### ⚙️ Features

* Basic user sign-up form
* Data handling using Java Servlets
* File-based storage (no database required)
* Designed for local network usage (LAN)

### ⚠️ Notes

This project is intended for **learning and local development purposes only**.
It does not implement production-level security and should not be used for public or internet-facing applications.
